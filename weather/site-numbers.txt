 Hi Graham.
  
Thanks for the positive feedback on Climate Data Online.
  
I have attached a list which maps the Daily Weather Observation (DWO)
location IDs to Bureau station numbers. There are a few things you
should be aware of before using this however:

1) The list I have provided relates the DWO ID to the site from which
temperature observations are taken (the primary Bureau site).
  
2) DWO location data can be taken from several sites, depending on
what elements are observed at the primary site. For example: For
Sydney, temperature, humidity, pressure, cloud and rainfall
observations are from Sydney (Observatory Hill) {station
066062}. Evaporation and sunshine observations are from Sydney
+Airport AMO {station 066037}. Wind observations are from Fort Denison
{station 066022}.
  
3) The list is quasi dynamic, in that occasionally the composition of
the DWO locations are changed (if related sites are closed for
example).
  
4) We may be changing the product later in the year to simply display
data from just the single primary site. While this may mean that some
elements may disappear from a DWO location, it +will permit us to
generate the product for all sites which measure temperature, and over
all years of record. Currently the construction of what sites to use
for each DWO location is +manually done, which is difficult to
maintain, or take backward in time.

I hope that this helps.

Cheers,
Ian
