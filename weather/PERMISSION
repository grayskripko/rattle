Subject: Using BOM data in textbook=20

I am writing a textbook on data mining using the statistical language R.
In scouting for some new data to demonstrate examples throughout the
book, I came across http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/.

I notice there is about 13 months of data. Do you archive the older data
somewhere that is accessible (personally, I don't understand why you
would remove the old files from their original locations over time
- e.g., http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/dwo/200711/text/IDCJDW2124.csv
appeared to disappear overnight)?

Are there restrictions on the use of this data? For example, could I
collect the data together over time myself and make it freely available
as part of the textbook, with due credit?
