The rattle repository. See the rattle.dev project for a folder one up from this folder in a clone. This rattle folder then sits inside that and the Makefile provided there does the magic to package up locally. This repo is a standard R package that can be installed with 

> devtools::install_bitbucket("kayontoga/rattle")
