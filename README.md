The rattle repository is hosted on
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle). See the
[rattle.dev](https://bitbucket.org/kayontoga/rattle.dev) project on
bitbucket for the development environment sitting over the rattle
project. This rattle folder then sits inside the rattle.dev folder and
the Makefile provided with rattle.dev does the processing to package
up locally. The rattle repository is a standard R package that can be
installed with:

`> devtools::install_bitbucket("kayontoga/rattle")`

Rattle is developed as an open source product by
[Togaware](http://www.togaware.com/) and is freely available to
